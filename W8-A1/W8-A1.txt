Considering the NamerConsole.py file, the Namerfactory decides which Namer class to use, without the client having to know about the details of the Namer Class.:
class NamerFactory():
    def __init__(self, namestring):
        self.name = namestring
    def getNamer(self):
        i = self.name.find(",") # if it finds a comma
        if i>0:
            return LastFirst(self.name) # get the LastFirst class
        else:
            return FirstFirst(self.name) # else get the FirstFirst

If NamerFactory find that the same has a comma as separation, it calls the LastFirst class, without needing to know what the class does. If it does not find a comma it calls the FirstFirst class.

The output is:
Enter name: Benedetti, Andre
 Andre Benedetti

Enter name: Andre Benedetti
Andre Benedetti
